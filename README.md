`keryx` is a CLI that installs a small `.metaproject/` workspace into any codebase, giving AI agents and developers one shared, versioned source of context: a code graph, an architecture wiki, normalized health and test reports, long-term memory, and agent skills. Instead of context scattered across scratchpads, CI logs, and IDE rule files that never agree, everything lives in one git-diffable place that both humans and agents read from.

The core is deterministic, local, and offline — with zero runtime dependencies. Every model-backed or precision feature is strictly opt-in, so a fresh install behaves identically whether or not you enable them.

> **Model assets are optional.** Features like semantic memory search, ML-based security detection, and tree-sitter parsing use downloadable models/grammars that are **not bundled and not required**. When an asset is absent, keryx automatically falls back to its deterministic implementation — nothing to configure, nothing breaks.

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** `git` and `bun` (>= 1.1.0). Code search (`keryx ctx rg` and the
agent's `search_code` tool) additionally requires [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
(`rg`) on `PATH` — install it with `brew install ripgrep` (macOS) or `apt install ripgrep`
(Debian/Ubuntu). Without it, code search is unavailable and the harness falls back to
reading files directly.

### Install / update (global)

Managed layout: `~/.keryx/keryx` + wrapper at `~/.local/bin/keryx`.
Re-run either command to upgrade.

```bash
# curl (short)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrCipherSmith/keryx/main/install | bash

# bun (short) — pipe into bun (Bun cannot run remote https://…/file.ts as entrypoint)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrCipherSmith/keryx/main/install.ts | bun -
```

Pure Bun without the `curl` binary:

```bash
bun -e 'await Bun.spawn(["bash","-s"],{stdin:await fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrCipherSmith/keryx/main/install"),stdout:"inherit",stderr:"inherit"}).exited'
```

Both paths run `scripts/install.sh --global` under the hood. Ensure `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Interactive shell (TUI agent harness)

Bare `keryx` is the **CLI** (lists commands / usage). The interactive TUI agent
harness starts only with **`keryx shell`**:

```bash
keryx              # CLI help — metaproject commands
keryx shell        # OpenTUI + agent harness (default UI)
```

Useful `shell` flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| *(default)* | TUI + agent |
| `--no-tui` | classic readline shell |
| `--chat` | chat without tools (readline) |
| `--agent` | agent mode explicitly |
| `--provider <p> --model <m>` | skip the provider/model picker |
| `--base-url <url>` | custom provider endpoint |

Examples:

```bash
keryx shell --provider ollama --model llama3.1:latest
keryx shell --no-tui
keryx shell --chat
```

### First project setup

```bash
cd path/to/your-project
keryx init

keryx gdgraph build          # code dependency graph
keryx test analyze           # testing context report
keryx health run --changed   # normalized health report

keryx dash                   # human admin dashboard
```

`keryx init` creates a `.metaproject/` workspace and connects your existing
`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` entrypoints to it, so agents are routed to the right
module automatically. See the
[onboarding guide](docs/docs/onboarding.md) for the full first-run walkthrough
and alternative install paths (managed curl installer, or project-local).

## Core Ideas

A few pieces of jargon, defined once:

- **gdgraph** — a *code graph*: language-aware dependency and import graph of your
  repo (TypeScript/JavaScript, Java via Maven/Gradle, and Python), with
  cycle/orphan queries, concept and symbol lookup, call-aware impact analysis,
  shortest paths, and a PageRank-ranked repo map.
- **gdctx** — *compact context output*: runs commands, searches, and file reads
  and stores condensed results so agents don't flood their context with raw logs.
- **gdwiki** — an *architecture wiki*: a Markdown knowledge base of domain
  models, decisions, and flows, with grounded `wiki ask` retrieval, hierarchical
  indexes, and backlinks between wiki pages and code.
- **gdskills** — *agent skills*: bundled and project-generated skills that route
  agents to the right workflow, plus verification and export to different runtimes.

## Modules

`keryx` itself is the toolkit core (`init`, `status`, `update`, `dashboard`,
`rules`, `standard`, `agents`) and manages the `.metaproject/` structure. It
ships these modules:

- **gdgraph** — code dependency graph with language-aware import resolution (TypeScript/JavaScript, Java Maven/Gradle, Python); concept search, file/symbol paths, affected-set blast radius, PageRank repo map, and an optional tree-sitter symbol/call graph.
- **gdctx** — compact command / search / read output plus opt-in routing guards for supported agent runtimes.
- **gdwiki** — Markdown project wiki with hierarchical indexes, backlinks, link checks, collection, and grounded retrieval.
- **gdskills** — bundled and generated agent skills with routing, verification, learning, and export.
- **health** — normalized code-health reports from TypeScript, tests, audit, complexity, coverage, and lint (optional SonarQube).
- **testing** — testing context, related-test selection, changed-scope runs, and an opt-in coverage-map Test Impact Analysis.
- **memory** — long-term Markdown project memory with indexing, search, dedup, bitemporal validity, and optional local embeddings.
- **tasks** — an agent-first Task Manager driven by `keryx flow` for issue/task lifecycle tracking.
- **security** — deterministic secrets / PII / prompt-injection / egress scanning, redaction, and a policy gate at agent write seams.
- **review** — managed review packages that preserve reviewer coverage, findings, decisions, learning candidates, and optional Task Manager links.
- **mcp** — opt-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server exposing read-only module services to agents.

Two cross-cutting commands improve agent startup and routing:

- `keryx orient` emits or installs a compact graph + wiki orientation block at
  turn start for Claude, Codex, and Cursor.
- `keryx agents bootstrap` installs the Metaproject discovery rule in supported
  global agent entrypoints.

## How Agents Use It

After `init`, agents follow the root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` pointer to
`.metaproject/index.md`, which routes them to the right module. For example:

```text
Find the files related to payment retry handling, explain the relationships,
and use the keryx tools for context discovery before broad raw search.
```

The agent is directed to use `gdgraph` for navigation, `gdctx` for large output,
`gdwiki` and `memory` for decisions and history, and `flow` for managed work —
only for the modules you've enabled.

For an always-current starting map, install the optional orientation hook:

```bash
keryx orient install-hook --runtime codex
```

For traceable review work, create a standalone review package or attach one to
an existing flow:

```bash
keryx review start --target branch --ref feature/example
keryx review attach --flow 001 --target pull-request --ref 42
```

For agents that speak the Model Context Protocol, `keryx mcp install` wires a
read-only MCP server into Cursor or Claude in one command (opt-in, off by
default). See the [architecture doc](docs/docs/architecture.md) for the module
data flows.

## CI Integration

`keryx` is designed so CI can publish normalized, committable artifacts that
humans and agents read later:

```bash
keryx gdgraph build
keryx test analyze
keryx health run --changed
keryx dashboard build
```

Use `keryx health gate --strict-warn` to fail a job on the normalized health
gate instead of parsing raw linter/test logs, and `keryx security eval --corpus
all` to fail on any detector breaching its committed false-negative threshold.
