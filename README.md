`keryx` is a CLI that installs a small `.metaproject/` workspace into any codebase, giving AI agents and developers one shared, versioned source of context: a code graph, an architecture wiki, normalized health and test reports, long-term memory, and agent skills. Instead of context scattered across scratchpads, CI logs, and IDE rule files that never agree, everything lives in one git-diffable place that both humans and agents read from.

The core is deterministic, local, and offline — with zero runtime dependencies. Every model-backed or precision feature is strictly opt-in, so a fresh install behaves identically whether or not you enable them.

> **Model assets are optional.** Features like semantic memory search, ML-based security detection, and tree-sitter parsing use downloadable models/grammars that are **not bundled and not required**. When an asset is absent, keryx automatically falls back to its deterministic implementation — nothing to configure, nothing breaks.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the CLI globally (curl)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrCipherSmith/keryx/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --global

# ...or with bun (no curl needed — bun is already a requirement)
bun -e 'await Bun.spawn(["bash","-s","--","--global"],{stdin:await fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrCipherSmith/keryx/main/scripts/install.sh"),stdout:"inherit",stderr:"inherit"}).exited'

# Initialize the workspace in your project
cd path/to/your-project
keryx init

# Build the first artifacts
keryx gdgraph build          # code dependency graph
keryx test analyze           # testing context report
keryx health run --changed   # normalized health report

# Open the human admin dashboard
keryx dash
```

`keryx init` creates a `.metaproject/` workspace and connects your existing
`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` entrypoints to it, so agents are routed to the right
module automatically. See the
[onboarding guide](docs/docs/onboarding.md) for the full first-run walkthrough
and alternative install paths (global via `bun`, or project-local).

**Requirements:** `git` and `bun` (>= 1.1.0).

## Interactive agent shell (TUI)

keryx ships a full-screen interactive agent shell. To (re)install the latest and
launch it in one line:

```bash
reset && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrCipherSmith/keryx/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --global && keryx shell --agent --tui
```

- `reset` clears the terminal first (optional).
- The `install.sh --global` step updates `~/.keryx/keryx` to `main` and refreshes
  the `keryx` launcher — run it whenever you want to pull the newest build.
- `keryx shell --agent --tui` opens the OpenTUI shell in **agent** mode. The TUI is
  opt-in via `--tui` and needs a real TTY; without it you get the plain readline
  shell. `--chat` swaps agent mode for plain conversation.

On first launch a picker walks you through **provider → model → API key**:

- **Providers:** any OpenAI-compatible gateway — OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Z.AI (GLM,
  incl. the flat-rate Coding Plan endpoint), Cerebras, Groq, Moonshot (Kimi) —
  plus a local Ollama and `anthropic` when their env keys are set.
- **Models:** the live model list is fetched per provider and is **type-to-filter**
  (start typing, e.g. `free`, to narrow it).
- **API key:** prompted when missing and saved owner-only (`0600`) to your keryx
  config dir, then reused on the next launch (an already-set env var always wins).
- **Navigation:** `↑/↓` + `Enter` to choose; `Esc` steps back a stage (key → model
  → provider), or cancels at the provider step.

Switch on the fly inside the shell with `/model` (change model) and `/connect`
(change provider / key); `/help` lists all commands.

## Core Ideas

A few pieces of jargon, defined once:

- **gdgraph** — a *code graph*: language-aware dependency and import graph of your
  repo (TypeScript/JavaScript, Java via Maven/Gradle, and Python), with
  cycle/orphan queries, concept and symbol lookup, call-aware impact analysis,
  shortest paths, and a PageRank-ranked repo map.
- **gdctx** — *compact context output*: runs commands, searches, and file reads
  and stores condensed results so agents don't flood their context with raw logs.
- **gdwiki** — an *architecture wiki*: a Markdown knowledge base of domain
  models, decisions, and flows, with grounded `wiki ask` retrieval, hierarchical
  indexes, and backlinks between wiki pages and code.
- **gdskills** — *agent skills*: bundled and project-generated skills that route
  agents to the right workflow, plus verification and export to different runtimes.

## Modules

`keryx` itself is the toolkit core (`init`, `status`, `update`, `dashboard`,
`rules`, `standard`, `agents`) and manages the `.metaproject/` structure. It
ships these modules:

- **gdgraph** — code dependency graph with language-aware import resolution (TypeScript/JavaScript, Java Maven/Gradle, Python); concept search, file/symbol paths, affected-set blast radius, PageRank repo map, and an optional tree-sitter symbol/call graph.
- **gdctx** — compact command / search / read output plus opt-in routing guards for supported agent runtimes.
- **gdwiki** — Markdown project wiki with hierarchical indexes, backlinks, link checks, collection, and grounded retrieval.
- **gdskills** — bundled and generated agent skills with routing, verification, learning, and export.
- **health** — normalized code-health reports from TypeScript, tests, audit, complexity, coverage, and lint (optional SonarQube).
- **testing** — testing context, related-test selection, changed-scope runs, and an opt-in coverage-map Test Impact Analysis.
- **memory** — long-term Markdown project memory with indexing, search, dedup, bitemporal validity, and optional local embeddings.
- **tasks** — an agent-first Task Manager driven by `keryx flow` for issue/task lifecycle tracking.
- **security** — deterministic secrets / PII / prompt-injection / egress scanning, redaction, and a policy gate at agent write seams.
- **review** — managed review packages that preserve reviewer coverage, findings, decisions, learning candidates, and optional Task Manager links.
- **mcp** — opt-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server exposing read-only module services to agents.

Two cross-cutting commands improve agent startup and routing:

- `keryx orient` emits or installs a compact graph + wiki orientation block at
  turn start for Claude, Codex, and Cursor.
- `keryx agents bootstrap` installs the Metaproject discovery rule in supported
  global agent entrypoints.

## How Agents Use It

After `init`, agents follow the root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` pointer to
`.metaproject/index.md`, which routes them to the right module. For example:

```text
Find the files related to payment retry handling, explain the relationships,
and use the keryx tools for context discovery before broad raw search.
```

The agent is directed to use `gdgraph` for navigation, `gdctx` for large output,
`gdwiki` and `memory` for decisions and history, and `flow` for managed work —
only for the modules you've enabled.

For an always-current starting map, install the optional orientation hook:

```bash
keryx orient install-hook --runtime codex
```

For traceable review work, create a standalone review package or attach one to
an existing flow:

```bash
keryx review start --target branch --ref feature/example
keryx review attach --flow 001 --target pull-request --ref 42
```

For agents that speak the Model Context Protocol, `keryx mcp install` wires a
read-only MCP server into Cursor or Claude in one command (opt-in, off by
default). See the [architecture doc](docs/docs/architecture.md) for the module
data flows.

## CI Integration

`keryx` is designed so CI can publish normalized, committable artifacts that
humans and agents read later:

```bash
keryx gdgraph build
keryx test analyze
keryx health run --changed
keryx dashboard build
```

Use `keryx health gate --strict-warn` to fail a job on the normalized health
gate instead of parsing raw linter/test logs, and `keryx security eval --corpus
all` to fail on any detector breaching its committed false-negative threshold.
