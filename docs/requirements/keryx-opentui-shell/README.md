# Keryx OpenTUI Interactive Shell — Requirements Package
Version: 0.2.0

## Status

`implemented`. Phases 0–5 shipped for the agent shell (flows 059–067); the chat
half of the scope was closed later by **flow 112**, which extracted a shared
`ShellChrome`, re-landed the agent shell on it, and added a chat driver that
renders `ShellIO` through the same chrome using the real `runShell`. Both modes
are now TUI by default on a TTY.

O-3, O-4 and O-5 were subsequently closed by flows 113 and 114 — in part rather
than outright in some cases, which is why **§10 in `specification.md` is the
authority and this paragraph is not**. The one open item is **O-6**, and it has
since been **narrowed**: a pty smoke now runs the real shell on a pseudo-terminal
in CI on macOS and asserts a frame was actually drawn. What remains open is
Linux and darwin-x64, the global-install clause, time-to-first-frame, and
anything past the first frame.

This package specified migrating the keryx interactive shell/agent UI from the
line-based `node:readline` renderer to a full-screen **OpenTUI**
(`@opentui/core`) terminal UI, to gain a live, Pi/grok-style command composer (an
as-you-type `/` command dropdown), a persistent input area, and a component-based
rendering model — WITHOUT rewriting the deterministic agent driver or the pure
render helpers already in place.

The renderer now lives in `src/tui/` and **the TUI is the default** on an
interactive TTY (`parseShellCliFlags` defaults `wantTui = true`); `--no-tui`
opts out and the readline shell remains the fallback whenever there is no TTY,
the optional dependency is absent, or the renderer fails to initialise.

### Delivery

| Phase | What | Flow(s) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Spike — native dep, scrollback, primitives, license, latency. GO verdict | 059 |
| 1 | `TuiShell` renderer skeleton wired to the driver, `--tui` opt-in; ADR-0005 ratifies the dependency | 060 |
| 2 | Chrome parity — markdown, role headers, tool + collapse, reasoning, usage | 061 |
| 3 | Live `/` command dropdown + shared command registry | 062 |
| 4 | Scrollable transcript, default-deny approval, resize | 063 |
| 5 | TUI default on TTY, `--no-tui` opt-out | 064; reverted by 065 over a stdin-handoff leak, root-caused in 066 and re-landed in 067 |

Phase 5's second half — "retire the readline path once at parity" — is **not**
done. It was blocked until flow 112 gave chat a TUI; it is now merely undone.
Readline stays the mandatory fallback for no-TTY, a missing optional dependency,
and renderer init failure, so retiring it is a separate scope decision.

Post-migration work that amends this package rather than extending the roadmap:
layout and UX passes (068–079), persistence and provider work (080–086), and
**flow 109** — the transcript block model (per-block collapse, copyable markdown
payloads, structural code/diff rendering). See §9 of `specification.md` for the
decisions those flows recorded.

### Runtime evidence

- `src/tui/shell-chrome.ts` — the mode-agnostic chrome both shells mount: layout,
  composer, `/`-menu, footer and busy spinner, toast, overlay guard,
  copy-on-select (flow 112).
- `src/tui/tui-shell.ts` — the agent renderer, implementing `AgentIO`
  (flows 060 skeleton + 061 chrome parity; re-landed on the chrome by flow 112).
- `src/tui/chat-shell.ts` — the chat renderer, implementing `ShellIO` and driven
  by the real `runShell`, so TUI chat and readline chat cannot diverge in
  behaviour (flow 112).
- `src/commands/shell.ts` — `chooseShellSurface(flags, isTty)` returns
  `"tui-agent" | "tui-chat" | "readline"`; both TUI surfaces fall back to
  readline on no-TTY, a missing optional dependency, or init failure.
- `src/commands/agent-commands.ts` — the mode-aware command registry
  (flow 062, made mode-aware by flow 112). The flattened `{name, description}` a
  menu needs is obtainable only through a mode, so a menu cannot show the other
  mode's wording. Three consumers: the TUI, chat readline, agent readline.
- `@opentui/core` declared under `optionalDependencies`, loaded via dynamic
  `import()` with a readline fallback. ADR-0005 is **Accepted (Phase 1)** and its
  guard update landed — the package is pinned in the optional-dependency set at
  `src/testing/block-d-no-network.test.ts:82`.
- Headless render tests: `src/tui/tui-shell.test.ts`.

Beyond the original Phase 0–5 scope, the TUI also gained side-workers
(`src/tui/side-worker.ts`, `worker-fleet.ts`), multi-agent spawn wiring
(`subagent-bridge.ts`, `ask-user-bridge.ts`), and dual-store session persistence
(`/compact`, `/resume`, `/continue`). These were added after the spec was written
and are not normatively described here; cite the flow numbers if a follow-on
requirements package is split out.

The foundation this package builds on — the port-based agent driver
(`src/commands/agent.ts` `runAgentTurn`), the `AgentIO`/`ShellIO` hook surface,
and the pure render helpers (flows 033, 048–057) — carried over as planned. The
driver and hook surface are unchanged by diff; the pure helper *layer* has since
been extended by flow 109, recorded as decision **D-6**.

## Why

The line-based `readline` renderer cannot draw a live dropdown under the cursor as
the user types (it reads whole lines on Enter and delegates echo/editing to the
terminal). Pi and xAI's grok-build show a live command menu because they are
full-screen TUIs that own the terminal and repaint every keystroke. Matching that
UX is an **architecture** change (an input/render layer that owns the terminal),
not a dependency add. OpenTUI is the chosen framework because it is Bun-native
(keryx runs on Bun) and already proven in a coding-agent TUI (`superagent-ai/grok-cli`).

## Scope

- **In:** an OpenTUI-based renderer for the interactive shell (chat + agent),
  behind a `--tui` opt-in flag first, then default; a live `/` command composer;
  re-homing the existing render chrome (markdown, gutter, tool-collapse, reasoning,
  usage, approval) onto OpenTUI components; a Phase 0 spike to de-risk the native
  dependency, scrollback behaviour, and component/API specifics.
- **Out:** changing `runAgentTurn` semantics, the metaproject port, providers,
  policy, the harness core, or the Task Manager/flow layer; a mouse-driven UI;
  editor/ACP embedding.

## Key decision + top risks

- **Decision:** adopt `@opentui/core` (imperative API) as the shell's render layer;
  keep the deterministic driver and pure helpers; swap only the IO implementation
  (`createRichIo` / `runAgentRepl` → an OpenTUI renderer implementing the same
  `AgentIO`/`ShellIO` hooks).
- **Risk R1 (native dependency) — resolved.** Prebuilt per-platform binary via npm
  optionalDependencies, no Zig at install; MIT. darwin-arm64 confirmed in the
  Phase 0 spike, other targets confirm as exercised. Ratified in ADR-0005, which
  also pins the optional-dependency contract (dynamic `import()` only, mandatory
  fallback, zero-`dependencies` floor untouched).
- **Risk R2 (scrollback) — resolved, cost accepted.** Alternate-screen mode was
  chosen, forfeiting native terminal scrollback as codex/claude do. Copy is served
  instead by OSC-52 (mouse selection, and `y` on a focused block since flow 109),
  and losing scrollback is precisely why flow 109's decision D-5 has to preserve
  the scroll offset when a block expands.
- **Risk R3 (rewrite surface) — mostly held, not fully.** The claim that "every
  flow-050–057 feature was re-homed without regression" was never evidenced, and
  when it finally was — [feature-parity-checklist.md](feature-parity-checklist.md),
  2026-07-22 — it turned out to be false in three of twenty-one rows: `cwd`
  vanished from the header, the agent/chat mode picker is unreachable on the TUI
  path, and the per-turn usage line was silently replaced by a cumulative header
  counter. Two of the three were fixed the same day and now carry regression
  tests — `cwd` as a sidebar `Directory` panel, and the usage hook wrapped rather
  than assigned so both readings render. The mode picker was resolved the other
  way: decision **D-A5** records that it is not coming back, since the confusion
  it prevented is already covered by agent-as-default plus the mode-labelled
  header, and a mid-session `/mode` would swap drivers rather than add chrome.
  The rest
  did carry over, with the logic kept in pure unit-tested helpers. Two further
  qualifications: that helper layer is no longer frozen (see decision **D-6**),
  and seven features were re-implemented rather than re-homed — authorised, and
  itemised in the checklist.
