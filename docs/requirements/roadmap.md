# Requirements Roadmap
Version: 0.5.0

## Status

This roadmap tracks Metaproject requirements packages and their implementation
state. Runtime claims must be backed by source, tests, or a verification report.

## Packages

| Package | Status | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [Managed Review Feedback Loop](managed-review-feedback-loop/README.md) | implemented (initial runtime slice) | Low-level managed review persistence supports standalone/attached packages, ingest, coverage, findings, decisions, learning, and structural completion. Target orchestration ownership moves to Flow Reviewer. |
| [Flow Reviewer](flow-reviewer/README.md) | specification ready (future) | Task Manager-aware review orchestrator above stateless Review Orchestrator, with one task and durable history per reviewer, adaptive model routing, compact shared context, resume, schemas, and Gherkin acceptance scenarios. |
| [gdgraph Java/Python Import Resolution](gdgraph-java-import-resolution/README.md) | implemented | Language-aware import resolver so Java (Maven/Gradle) and Python source produce real dependency edges instead of nodes-only graphs; fixes the `0/0 = 100%` resolution-metric bug and seeds Java/Python grammars. Verified on example-backend: 0 → 47,984 edges, 94% in-repo resolution. |
| [Keryx Execution Observability](keryx-execution-observability/README.md) | implemented (runtime capability; benchmark harness ready) | Provenance-aware execution metrics, active-time accounting, per-run evidence, baseline-aware CI, lightweight profiles, retry taxonomy, and paired Keryx/no-Keryx validation protocol. No performance claim has been made. |
| [Keryx Telegram Companion Transport](keryx-telegram-transport/README.md) | specification ready (future) | Optional private-chat companion transport around the future Project Agent Harness: local long polling, explicit chat binding, bounded notifications, policy-constrained approvals, cancellation of own active operation, typed intents, and no remote control plane in Release 0. |
