# ADR-0001: Release 0 Boundary and Measurable Success Criteria

**Status**: Accepted / Frozen 2026-07-12

**Decision ID**: D-01  
**Task**: implementation-plan.md §W1 row D-01  
**Reviewer Track**: architecture  
**Source of Truth**: docs/requirements/keryx-project-agent-harness/

---

## Context

Keryx must transition from a project context plane (producing graph, wiki, memory, skills, health, security, flow, and review artifacts consumed by external agent runtimes) to an independent, project-oriented agent harness that owns the execution loop, model interface, tool runtime, permissions, sessions, quality gates, evidence, and resumable orchestration.

The first implementation slice (Release 0) is frozen as an offline, read-only vertical slice to reduce implementation scope and verify the provider-neutral contract, session model, context assembly, policy engine, and evidence ledger in isolation before adding mutation, real providers, child agents, and recovery complexity.

This decision freezes the Release 0 scope boundary (explicit inclusions and exclusions), maps Release 0 scenarios and success criteria from the PRD to measurable verification gates, and records signed decision positions for all Release 0 boundary questions.

## Decision

### Release 0 Boundary

**Release 0 is an offline, read-only vertical slice.** The following capabilities are explicitly INCLUDED in Release 0:

1. **Offline fake provider** — a deterministic provider implementation that emits synthetic model responses from recorded transcripts.
2. **One registered read-only tool** — a single tool that can read project files within the approved worktree; no mutation, shell execution, or network access.
3. **Provider-neutral event loop** — a model request/response loop that normalizes provider-specific events (text, tool calls, usage, finish reasons, retries, transient errors) to a provider-neutral schema; provider-specific extensions remain namespaced but do not leak into domain code.
4. **Minimal append-only session** — a durable JSONL-based session storage with stable entry IDs, parent links, sequence numbers, and content hashes; supports reconstruction of the current leaf without hidden chain-of-thought.
5. **Context manifest** — a bounded, hash-addressed project context scope (code graph, wiki, memory, rules, skills, testing, health, security references) with metadata, freshness indicators, and provenance.
6. **Evidence-linked output** — every meaningful action (model request, tool call, policy decision, completion gate) is linked to a redacted evidence record with artifact hash, action fingerprint, and timing.
7. **CLI and JSONL/RPC semantic parity** — the same run logic executed through CLI (interactive or batch) and through JSONL/RPC (headless) produces semantically equivalent normalized events, policy results, and gate output.
8. **Deterministic offline replay** — given recorded fake-provider transcripts, tool fixtures (hash-bound recorded results), and session history, the orchestration and policy layers can replay a run offline without network access, provider execution, or mutating tool invocation; replay reports typed mismatches when expected and actual evidence differ.

**The following capabilities are explicitly EXCLUDED (deferred to Release 1 or later):**

1. **No mutation** — no filesystem writes, git operations, or environment modifications; all tools are read-only.
2. **No unrestricted shell** — no direct command execution; no shell pipeline features; no unrestricted argv or environment substitution.
3. **No network** — no HTTP, DNS, or socket operations; network-bound tools are deferred.
4. **No child agents** — no isolated subprocess spawning with separate budgets, prompts, or tool permissions; child-agent dispatch and result framing are deferred.
5. **No parallel tool calls** — tool calls execute serially; bounded parallel scheduling of multiple tools is deferred.
6. **No executable extensions** — no third-party plugins, dynamic code loading, or capability-grant registration at runtime.
7. **No provider-side session storage** — no state persistence on the model provider's infrastructure; all session state is local and authoritative.
8. **No TUI** — no terminal user interface; CLI and JSONL/RPC are the only transports.

### Measurable Release 0 Success Criteria

Each criterion maps to one or more Release 0 scenarios (R0-01, R0-02, R0-03) defined in acceptance.feature and to a row in the PRD §Success Criteria.

| Criterion | Source | Scenarios | Verification |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Deterministic floor preserved** | PRD §Success Criteria (1) | R0-01, R1, R14 | With `harness.enabled=false`, deterministic Keryx commands execute with byte-identical behavior; no provider is loaded and no harness network socket is opened. Measured against pre-harness baseline. |
| **Offline fake-provider startup** | PRD §Success Criteria (1) | R0-01 | An explicitly enabled Release 0 run starts with configured fake provider, model identifier, credential reference, policy profile, and role; only the Keryx harness and fake provider are active; no external coding-agent runtime is required. |
| **Startup preconditions enforced** | PRD §Success Criteria (2) | R0-01, R2, R12 | Missing provider, model, credential reference, policy profile, or role produces a typed `environment_blocked` result at startup; no partial provider request or network attempt is made. |
| **Bounded context manifest** | PRD §Success Criteria (3) | R0-02, R2, R7 | Context manifest size stays within documented byte (≤ 2 MiB) and token (≤ 200,000 estimated tokens) ceilings; manifests include scope, project root, policy, and schema fingerprints; freshness and provenance are recorded. |
| **Schema validation positive/negative** | PRD §Success Criteria (5) | R0-02 | Every Release 0 JSON schema (25+ schemas) accepts all positive fixtures and rejects all negative fixtures under a Draft 2020-12-capable validator; schema version registry is current. |
| **Fake-provider transcript completion** | PRD §Success Criteria (4) | R0-02, R3, R14 | A recorded fake-provider transcript (text, tool calls, usage, finish) drives one complete read-only tool loop offline; no network socket is opened. |
| **CLI and JSONL/RPC parity** | PRD §Success Criteria (4) | R0-03, R13 | CLI execution and JSONL/RPC execution produce semantically equivalent normalized events, policy decisions, gate results, and output; transport does not alter policy or completion gates. |
| **Offline replay without effects** | PRD §Success Criteria (6) | R0-03, R14, R17 | Offline replay from recorded provider/tool fixtures reproduces policy and orchestration state transitions exactly; replay does not invoke a live provider, network, or mutating tool. |
| **Replay mismatch detection** | PRD §Success Criteria (6) | R0-03, R12, R17 | When recorded provider or tool evidence differs from expected, replay reports a typed mismatch (changed input hash, changed output hash, unexpected event); replay does not fall back to live execution. |
| **Completion gate enforcement** | PRD §Success Criteria (7) | R0-02, R10, R11 | Completion is rejected when any required gate (evidence references, policy decision finality, approved actions, schema validation) is absent; a final assistant message alone is not sufficient. |

## Consequences for Later Waves

**Release 1 (W8–W12)** introduces:
- Durable resume with fingerprint validation and stale-run detection.
- Branching (fork, current leaf, immutable ancestors) and typed compaction (source range, summary hash, evidence preservation).
- Guarded mutation (path-checked, approval-bound, receipt-recorded) behind security profiles (`monitored-trusted-local`, `unattended-untrusted`).
- First real provider adapter behind a capability flag and retention/privacy contract.
- Single-coordinator flow integration through evolved Task Manager API.
- Child-agent dispatch and result through canonical `subagent-dispatch`/`subagent-result` contracts.

**Release 2+ (W14+)** defers:
- Additional real provider adapters and network broker-mediated tools.
- Third-party executable extensions with capability grants and isolation gates.
- Interactive terminal UI and external compatibility adapters.
- Provider-side session storage and implicit provider continuation.

All Release 1+ work depends on Release 0 acceptance of the provider-neutral event loop, policy contract, session model, evidence ledger, and off-line replay accuracy. A Release 1 work item may not proceed until its Release 0 dependency passes acceptance gates.

## Open Items (Explicitly Deferred — Never Guess)

The following questions are recorded in PRD §Decisions and Open Questions and must remain open until their corresponding Release 1+ phase. No implementation worker is authorized to resolve these during Release 0.

| Item | Question | Deferred to | Status |
|------|----------|---|--------|
| **OPEN-1** | Concrete first real provider adapter (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLM) and its credential configuration shape | Release 1 (W5 task P-01) | OPEN — decision belongs to provider-port implementation task |
| **OPEN-2** | Per-role budget values beneath the global SLO ceilings in README (e.g., "planning" vs "review" role token ceilings, tool-call budgets per role) | Release 1 (W2 task TM-01, W5 task P-01) | OPEN — decision belongs to Task Manager evolution and provider-adapter implementation |
| **OPEN-3** | Artifact retention windows per class (session, evidence, compaction) under team vs solo policy (e.g., when to archive or delete old sessions) | Release 1 (W11 task FI-01) | OPEN — decision belongs to flow integration and task manager evolution |
| **OPEN-4** | Whether `src/harness/` (current fixture-corpus evaluator) relocation lands as a direct rename to `src/eval/` or as a staged alias/migration path | Release 0 prerequisite (W3 task EV-01) | OPEN — decision belongs to corpus-harness relocation task (no implementation in W1) |

No Release 0 boundary decision is marked OPEN. All Release 0 capability statements above are SIGNED.
