## Phase 3 — verification + review (flow-orchestrator; worker interrupted, orchestrator finished)
- task-implementer (038-T2) was stopped mid test-run after writing code (tsc was clean). Orchestrator completed verification independently.
- New: src/harness/tool/metaproject-operations.ts (single METAPROJECT_OPERATIONS source + toInteractiveTools/toToolDefinitions projections + shared formatters) + metaproject-operations.test.ts. metaproject-tools.ts delegates to toInteractiveTools when a port is present (subprocess fallback unchanged).
- Independent verify: `bunx tsc --noEmit` clean; `bun test` **1411 pass / 3 skip / 0 fail** (baseline 1403; +8). `dependencies` {}.
- Self-review of metaproject-operations.ts: 5 descriptors (search_code/graph_affected/graph_query/memory_search/read_wiki), risk read, schema-validated, pure projections carry names/risk/schemas; ToolDefinition projection populates limits/replay/classification. PASS.
- AC1–AC3 satisfied; AC4 automated portion satisfied (MCP untouched, out of scope).
- 2026-07-17T22:23:49.254Z - task-done: T2: Implement per plan
- 2026-07-17T22:23:49.373Z - task-done: T3: Add/adjust tests and make them pass
- 2026-07-17T22:23:49.504Z - task-done: T4: Self-review and prepare draft PR
- 2026-07-17T22:24:23.816Z - implemented: draft PR: https://github.com/MrCipherSmith/keryx/pull/50
- 2026-07-17T22:24:47.799Z - ac-confirmed: AC1: metaproject-operations.ts: METAPROJECT_OPERATIONS 5 descriptors; operations.test.ts validates each against metaproject-operation.schema.json
- 2026-07-17T22:24:47.945Z - ac-confirmed: AC2: toInteractiveTools + toToolDefinitions pure projections; tested one-tool-per-descriptor, risk read, schemas, fake-port delegation
- 2026-07-17T22:24:48.118Z - ac-confirmed: AC3: builtinMetaprojectTools delegates to toInteractiveTools(METAPROJECT_OPERATIONS, port) when port present; subprocess fallback unchanged; tests green
- 2026-07-17T22:24:48.244Z - ac-confirmed: AC4: independent verify: tsc clean, bun test 1411 pass/0 fail (baseline 1403), offline/deterministic, deps {}, MCP untouched
- 2026-07-17T22:24:55.872Z - completing
- 2026-07-17T22:24:55.931Z - done: all gates passed
