- 2026-07-20T22:42:43.797Z - frozen: 6 criteria; checksum recorded
- 2026-07-20T22:42:43.882Z - started
- 2026-07-20T22:46:09.552Z - task-done: T1: Collect remaining context
- 2026-07-20T22:46:09.639Z - task-done: T2: Implement per plan
- 2026-07-20T22:46:09.722Z - task-done: T3: Add/adjust tests and make them pass
- 2026-07-20T22:46:09.801Z - task-done: T4: Self-review and prepare draft PR
- 2026-07-20T22:46:09.873Z - ac-confirmed: AC1: BudgetReservation.costUnits? added (isolation.ts); inheritBudget unchanged — ignores costUnits, subset check stays runtime+tool-calls only
- 2026-07-20T22:46:09.957Z - ac-confirmed: AC2: LedgerLimits.maxCostUnits?; admit decrements cost alongside runtime/tool-calls when set; reservation cost > remaining => fail-closed 'cost cap exceeded'
- 2026-07-20T22:46:10.038Z - ac-confirmed: AC3: all checks (count->inheritBudget->cost) before any mutation; cost-denial test asserts remaining/childCount/costRemaining unchanged
- 2026-07-20T22:46:10.124Z - ac-confirmed: AC4: no maxCostUnits => costRemaining undefined, costUnits on reservation ignored, behavior unchanged; ledger/spawn/scheduler suites 64/64 green
- 2026-07-20T22:46:10.199Z - ac-confirmed: AC5: property sweep: aggregate admitted cost never exceeds cap across many caps/costs; pure/deterministic (no Date.now/Math.random)
- 2026-07-20T22:46:10.278Z - ac-confirmed: AC6: ledger.test.ts cost block added; full suite 1786 pass/0 fail (--timeout 30000, incl dep guard); tsc clean
