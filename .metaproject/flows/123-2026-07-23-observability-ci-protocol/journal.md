## Implementation & verification (T5-T6)

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` rewritten: the single `check` job is replaced by the
four protocol jobs; the three unrelated jobs are preserved verbatim.

- **standard baseline exit-code semantics were probed first** to wire the verdict
  correctly: `--baseline pass --pr fail` → exit 1 (isolated regression, fail the
  job); `--baseline fail --pr fail` → exit 0 (baseline-red, diagnostic);
  `--baseline unknown --pr *` → exit 0. So `standard-pr`'s final classification
  step exit code fails the job ONLY for baseline-green + pr-fail. The baseline job
  captures pass/fail without hard-failing on a red main.
- **YAML valid** (ruby YAML parser): jobs = typecheck-and-tests, standard-baseline,
  standard-pr, metrics-contract, tui-pty-launch, linux-sandbox,
  opentui-native-matrix.
- **metrics-contract tests green locally**: `bun test src/metrics/service.test.ts
  src/lib/git-hooks.test.ts src/lib/templates.test.ts` → 11 pass / 0 fail.
- **standard validate** locally → exit 0 (PASS, 1 warning).
- **Security eval gate retained** (moved verbatim into typecheck-and-tests); no
  prior coverage dropped.
- **Limitation (honest)**: GitHub Actions cannot be executed locally, so end-to-end
  green CI is observable only after this is pushed. Local verification proves YAML
  validity + that every referenced command/test exists and passes.

## AC7 — deferred items & required admin action

1. **Paired Keryx/no-Keryx benchmark run** (audit AC-10): a measurement activity,
   not code. The benchmark harness/template is already shipped
   (src/metrics/benchmark.ts) and the roadmap status is "benchmark harness ready".
   Deferred — running it is a separate, non-code task.
2. **Branch-protection required-check rename (ADMIN ACTION REQUIRED)**: the old
   required status check was the `check` job (`name: "typecheck, tests, standard"`).
   This flow removed that job. A repo admin must update branch protection on `main`
   to require the new jobs (at least `typecheck-and-tests` and `standard-pr`) —
   this flow cannot change repository settings. Until then, `main` protection may
   wait on a check that no longer runs.
