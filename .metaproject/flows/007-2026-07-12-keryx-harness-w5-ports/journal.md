- 2026-07-12T17:12:07.543Z - ac-updated: P-02 must validate tool-call input against the tool's INLINE inputSchema; the W4 validator only exposed file-based validateAgainstSchema. Amend AC4/AC5 to permit a minimal additive inline-schema export (validateAgainstSchemaObject) reusing the existing validateNode core in src/contracts — reuse, not a new validator engine; no behavior change to existing exports, no new dependency.

## Orchestrator notes — W5 verification & concerns

- **TDD RED→GREEN, per port:** P-01 T5 RED (import error) → T6 GREEN (provider 21
  pass); P-02 T7 RED → T8 GREEN (tool 23 pass). Full `bun test` 633 → **677 pass /
  0 fail**; `tsc --noEmit` clean. Independently re-verified by orchestrator.
- **Worktree-guard worked:** both provider and tool files landed in the FEATURE
  worktree (no stray writes to phase-1 this wave — the W4 guard directive held).
- **AC amendment (documented, sanctioned):** mid-flow `keryx flow ac update` amended
  AC4/AC5 to permit ONE minimal additive export in src/contracts
  (`validateAgainstSchemaObject`, reuses existing `validateNode`) — the W4 validator
  only exposed file-based validation, but tool `inputSchema` is INLINE. Confirmed
  purely additive: `git diff src/contracts/validator.ts` adds only the new function;
  existing exports/behavior unchanged; contracts suite still 79/0.
- **Two boundary proofs (T9):** (a) NO provider SDK type crosses the provider port —
  the only `@anthropic-ai|openai|@google` hit under src/harness is a test's
  banned-pattern regex string, not an import; (b) the model cannot reach fs/shell —
  `ToolExecutorPort` exposes only `invoke`; execution is gated behind
  `validateToolCall` (envelope + registration + inline inputSchema); unregistered/
  invalid calls never reach execution; Release 0 registers no real tools.
- **Wire-vs-in-memory deltas resolved:** P-01 request validates the model-request
  WIRE payload (serialization is an adapter concern); P-02 snapshot projects each
  tool to the `{toolId,version,definitionHash}` wire record for `tool-registry-snapshot`
  and registryHash (sha256 over canonical JSON, deterministic); classification is
  in-memory-only (not in the frozen tool-definition schema).
- **Minor orchestrator fix:** T6 flagged 3 `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` tsc errors in
  the T5 test file (unguarded array indexing — a test-quality defect the impl can't
  fix). Orchestrator applied 3 non-null assertions (`arr[i]!`) — non-weakening; tsc
  then clean. T7 was told to pre-guard indexing (it did; no fix needed for P-02).
- **T9 review: CLEAN** — 8/8 PASS, AC1–AC5 SATISFIED. Two LOW notes (toolName==toolId
  convention comment; wire-projection test uses a fixture hash) — non-blocking.
- **Scope:** port-only (no real/fake provider, no real tools, no CLI wiring — those
  are W6/W7). New code under src/harness/{provider,tool} + one additive src/contracts
  export; frozen requirements pkg + src/eval + ADRs untouched; deps still {}.
- 2026-07-12T17:52:37.641Z - ac-confirmed: AC1: src/harness/provider: neutral ProviderPort, 8 events/9 errors/4 attempt-outcomes/9 caps, sequence-numbered+attempt-scoped, unknownExtensions preserved; 0 provider-SDK imports (T9 boundary proof a).
- 2026-07-12T17:52:37.697Z - ac-confirmed: AC2: toolCallExecutable true ONLY for tool_call_end with parseable JSON input; false for partial/delta and non-end kinds (traced by T9).
- 2026-07-12T17:52:37.751Z - ac-confirmed: AC3: src/harness/tool: ToolDefinition/Registry(+snapshot/registryHash)/ExecutorPort(only invoke); validateToolCall 3-stage (envelope+registration+inline inputSchema); ToolExecutionState; no fs/shell surface; unregistered/invalid rejected (T9 boundary proof b).
- 2026-07-12T17:52:37.808Z - ac-confirmed: AC4: reuse W4 validateAgainstSchema (file) + additive validateAgainstSchemaObject (inline, reuses validateNode); src/contracts diff additive-only, contracts 79/0; deps={} (no new dep).
- 2026-07-12T17:52:37.863Z - ac-confirmed: AC5: tsc --noEmit clean; full bun test 677/0 (633 baseline + new); new code under src/harness/ + 1 additive src/contracts export; frozen requirements pkg + src/eval + ADRs untouched (git empty).
