## Finding: what the suite actually contended on

Measured with `scripts/stress/concurrent-suite-stress.ts` (AC1), N=6 concurrent
full suites in one worktree, on `test/suite-isolation`.

- **Before:** 25 failures across 6 runs (per-run: 6, 7, 7, 0, 5, 0).
- **After:** 0 failures across 3 waves of 6 (18 runs), plus a 4th wave below.
- Sequential baseline unchanged throughout: 2101 pass / 11 skip / 0 fail.

### The shared resource (AC2)

Two families, one root cause: **a fixture whose root is a fixed path is not
private to the run that created it.**

1. `path.join(tmpdir(), "keryx-<name>")` — resolves to the *same* directory for
   every checkout on the machine, so it collides **across worktrees**. This is
   why running from separate worktrees did not help. 26 sites.
2. `path.join(import.meta.dir, "..", "..", ".tmp-<name>")` — the repo root, so
   it collides between concurrent processes **in one worktree**. 7 sites.

Every failing test began with `rm -rf <root>` (`reset(root)` or an inline
`rm`). Two runs interleaving that teardown/setup is the whole mechanism: run A
deletes the tree run B is mid-way through reading or writing. The three symptom
shapes all reduce to it:

- `ENOENT … open '<root>/…'` — the file the test just wrote was deleted.
- `immutable testing run already exists: run-testing-provenance` /
  `immutable health run already exists: run-health-provenance` — the fixed
  `runId` was never the defect. The id is namespaced *under* the root, so it is
  only ambiguous because the root was shared: the test read another run's
  leftover artifact. Making the root unique makes the id unique.
- `Expected and actual values must be numbers or bigints` — a metric read back
  as `undefined` from a JSON artifact that had been deleted and half-rewritten.

### `posix_spawn 'git'` ENOENT — diagnosed, not worked around (AC4)

**Verdict: a repository defect, the same one — a vanished cwd. Not fd/process
exhaustion, and not PATH resolution.** Evidence:

- Direct reproduction: `Bun.spawnSync(["git","status"], { cwd: <dir that does
  not exist> })` throws *exactly* the observed string —
  `ENOENT: no such file or directory, posix_spawn 'git'`, with
  `syscall: posix_spawn`, `code: ENOENT`, `path: git`. The error names the
  **binary** but the missing path is the **cwd**, which is what made it look
  like a PATH or environment problem.
- `git` resolves fine throughout: `Bun.which("git")` → `/opt/homebrew/bin/git`,
  and thousands of other spawns in the same runs succeeded.
- Exhaustion is excluded by the errno: an fd/process limit surfaces as `EMFILE`
  / `EAGAIN`, never `ENOENT`.
- It only ever hit tests that spawn `git` with a *fixture* cwd
  (`hotspot.test.ts` seeding a git history, `service.test.ts` `gitInit`) — i.e.
  precisely the shared roots — and it disappeared entirely once the roots
  became unique.

### The fix (AC3)

`src/lib/test-tmp.ts` → `uniqueTestRoot(parent, prefix)`, a `mkdtemp` under the
**same parent directory the fixture already used**, so nothing path-sensitive
about any fixture changes — only its identity becomes private. 33 roots across
15 test files. No test was serialised, no retry was added, and no assertion was
weakened (AC7): the diff changes only how each root is *named*.

### Residual, reported rather than hidden (AC7)

`src/harness/process/sandbox/proxy-tls.test.ts` —
`no HTTPS substitution for a host outside injectHosts` failed once in 24
post-fix concurrent runs. It is **not** a shared-resource collision: the proxy
and upstream both bind ephemeral ports (`listen(0)`) and the run CA uses
`mkdtemp`. It does real TLS handshakes and shells out to `openssl`, so it is
load-sensitive on a saturated machine. 10 targeted concurrent runs of that file
alone did not reproduce it. Left as-is rather than given a timeout bump or a
retry, and recorded in `docs/docs/onboarding.md`.
