# Flow Journal

- 2026-07-22T12:05:44.354Z - flow created
- 2026-07-22T12:09:14.640Z - task-added: T5: Repo-wide id allocation: shared git-common-dir lock + ledger in nextFlowId/init (with non-git fallback)
- 2026-07-22T12:09:14.810Z - task-added: T6: Ambiguity-safe resolveFlowDir + fail-closed callers (flow CLI, review --flow, ManagedFlowPort)
- 2026-07-22T12:09:14.998Z - task-added: T7: Duplicate-id rule in keryx flow check + collision marker in flow list
- 2026-07-22T12:09:15.158Z - task-added: T8: keryx flow renumber command (move dir, rewrite flow.json id, history event, old->new mapping)
- 2026-07-22T12:09:15.299Z - task-added: T9: Repair existing collisions 002/084/103 via renumber; handle the 002 AC checksum mismatch explicitly
- 2026-07-22T12:09:15.446Z - task-added: T10: Document repo-wide allocation + worktree rule in flow skill and project memory
- 2026-07-22T13:43:11.496Z - frozen: 10 criteria; checksum recorded
- 2026-07-22T13:43:17.203Z - started
- 2026-07-22 - decisions taken before freeze (user): (1) repair colliding pairs by renumbering the later-created member via the new `keryx flow renumber`; (2) the duplicate-id rule in `keryx flow check` is a hard gate failure, flipped hard only after T9 lands so `main` is never knowingly red.
- 2026-07-22 - pre-existing, unrelated to this flow's changes: `keryx flow check` already fails on `002-2026-07-10-gdgraph-java-python-import-resolution` (acceptance criteria checksum mismatch). Tracked by AC8 — must not be silently rewritten by the renumbering in T9.
- 2026-07-22T18:57:56.854Z - task-done: T5: Repo-wide id allocation: shared git-common-dir lock + ledger in nextFlowId/init (with non-git fallback)
- 2026-07-22T18:57:57.005Z - task-done: T6: Ambiguity-safe resolveFlowDir + fail-closed callers (flow CLI, review --flow, ManagedFlowPort)
- 2026-07-22T18:57:57.128Z - task-done: T7: Duplicate-id rule in keryx flow check + collision marker in flow list
- 2026-07-22T18:57:57.283Z - task-done: T8: keryx flow renumber command (move dir, rewrite flow.json id, history event, old->new mapping)
- 2026-07-22 - T9 repair: the later-created member of each colliding pair was renumbered (createdAt from flow.json decides "later", since the 002 pair entered git in a single import commit). 002 -> 117 (implement-keryx-execution-observability, created 11:40 vs 10:18), 084 -> 118 (provider-picker, 15:02 vs 14:53), 103 -> 119 (p0-sandbox-credential-auto-mask, 07-21 15:04 vs 13:34). Mapping in .metaproject/flows/id-map.json; `flow check` now reports zero duplicate-id issues.
- 2026-07-22 - AC8 disposition: the acceptance-criteria checksum mismatch on `002-2026-07-10-gdgraph-java-python-import-resolution` is left UNTOUCHED, knowingly. It predates this branch (`keryx flow check` fails on it on main at b6b4ed0) and 002 is `done`, so the sanctioned repair — `keryx flow ac update` — would re-freeze the criteria and clear the AC confirmations that are the completed flow's own evidence. Losing that record is worse than the stale checksum. Renumbering did not touch the file: 002 kept its number, and no acceptance-criteria.md was rewritten anywhere.
