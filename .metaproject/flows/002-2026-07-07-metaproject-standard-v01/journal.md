## Verification notes (flow-orchestrator, Phase 3)

- task-implementer returned STATUS: DONE. tsc clean; `bun test` 105 pass / 0 fail (7 new standard tests).
- Independent verification: `standard capabilities`, `standard validate`, `standard doctor` all function; real exit code on validate failure = 1 (AC1).
- Self-compliance (AC4): regenerated `.metaproject/metaproject.json` with `standardVersion`/`profiles`/`updatedAt` (via `update --skip-runtime`, reverted other generated files) and committed only the manifest change.
- Finding from validation: the `tasks` module declares `data: .metaproject/data/tasks`, which does not exist (tasks stores flows under `.metaproject/flows`). Per `artifact-lifecycle.md`, module `data/` dirs are generated lazily/gitignored → fixed `src/standard/validate.ts` to treat a missing module `data` dir as a **warning**, not an error (canonical `manifest`/`core`/`skills`/`wiki`/`memory` paths stay errors). After the fix `standard validate` PASSES on this repo (exit 0, 1 informational warning).
- Concerns accepted from implementer (recorded, non-blocking): disabled-module stubs validated only for `enabled` boolean; `ci` profile satisfaction is lenient (artifacts dir, not transient latest.*); `update` appends standard fields (key order differs from `init`, both schema-valid).
- Follow-up (out of scope): consider dropping the spurious `data: .metaproject/data/tasks` declaration from the tasks manifest generator, or creating the dir on init, to remove the warning.
- Dispatched adversarial code review of `src/standard/**` + generator changes before draft PR.
- Review finding (confidence 85, CONFIRMED + fixed): `evaluateProfiles` reported the `agent` profile satisfied on ANY workspace because `hasAnyAgentSkill` matched the always-created `skills/project-rules/` folder. Fixed `src/standard/profiles.ts` to base `agent` satisfaction on an enabled AGENT_MODULE (gdgraph/gdctx/gdskills/gdwiki/memory) plus the on-disk entrypoint/rules checks — consistent with `computeProfiles`. Verified: zero-module workspace now satisfies only `minimal`. Added a regression test (`standard.test.ts`). Suite now 106 pass / 0 fail, tsc clean.
- Review's lower-confidence notes recorded as non-blocking follow-ups: `writeRecoveredManifest` gdwiki.data path differs from `init` (warning-only, likely pre-existing); `applyStandardManifestFields` only backfills the 3 new fields (narrow edge case); `SCHEMA_REGISTRY` $ref path is unused (dead code, not a bug).
- code-verifier equivalent complete: tsc clean, 106 tests pass, `standard validate` PASS (exit 0) on this repo, `standard doctor` actionable, `standard capabilities` correct.
- 2026-07-07T17:50:22.737Z - task-done: T4: Self-review and prepare draft PR
- 2026-07-07T17:50:24.947Z - implemented: draft PR: https://github.com/MrCipherSmith/meta-project/pull/4
- 2026-07-07T17:50:37.711Z - ac-confirmed: AC1: standard validate implemented (src/standard/validate.ts + commands/standard.ts); checks required files, manifest-vs-schema, paths, module manifests, entrypoint link, profiles; exit 1 on errors (verified).
- 2026-07-07T17:50:37.815Z - ac-confirmed: AC2: standard doctor prints actionable fix hints per issue; exit non-zero on errors (verified via runDoctor).
- 2026-07-07T17:50:37.920Z - ac-confirmed: AC3: standard capabilities prints standardVersion, declared+satisfied profiles, and each enabled module with commands (verified on this repo).
- 2026-07-07T17:50:38.024Z - ac-confirmed: AC4: init+update emit standardVersion/profiles/updatedAt via shared computeProfiles; repo metaproject.json regenerated self-compliant; standard validate exit 0.
- 2026-07-07T17:50:38.127Z - ac-confirmed: AC5: 8 standard tests (pass, missing standardVersion, missing module manifest, missing declared path, capabilities, profiles full+minimal-only regression); bun test 106 pass / 0 fail; tsc clean.
- 2026-07-07T17:50:38.236Z - ac-confirmed: AC6: docs/docs/cli-reference.md + README (standard command) updated; metaproject-standard spec/prd/ci-protocol status notes updated to implemented; no doc-code drift.

## Orchestrator notes

- History reconciliation: `origin/main` was force-updated (035d248 → c4551ab, "security docs + requirements package skills") while this flow ran. This branch had no common ancestor, so it was rebuilt on the new main via `git cherry-pick` (clean, zero conflicts) and force-pushed; re-verified tsc + 106 tests + `standard validate` PASS on the combined tree. Backup ref: `backup-standard-a1caa70`.
- Adversarial review finding (fixed): `evaluateProfiles` reported `agent` satisfied on any workspace because it matched the always-created `skills/project-rules/` folder. Fixed in `src/standard/profiles.ts` (require an enabled AGENT_MODULE) + regression test.
- COMPLETION GATE BLOCKER (open): `flow complete` fails only the `pull-request` gate — the repo has no `.github/workflows/`, so PR #4 has 0 checks and `github tracker` (`gh pr checks`, exitCode===0) reads "no checks" as not-green. Environmental, not a code defect. Awaiting user decision: (A) add minimal CI so the PR gets a green check [recommended; matches ci-protocol.md], (B) merge PR manually then close the flow, or (C) leave at implemented until CI exists.
- 2026-07-07T18:14:54.713Z - task-added: T8: Add minimal CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml) to satisfy PR-checks completion gate
