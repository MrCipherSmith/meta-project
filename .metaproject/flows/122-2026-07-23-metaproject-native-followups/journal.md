## Implementation & verification (T5-T9)

Implemented via TDD by task-implementer worker; independently re-verified by the
orchestrator (not trusted on the worker's word):

- `bunx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0, clean.
- `bun test` touched suites (run.metaproject / metaproject-operations /
  metaproject-adapter / mcp metaproject-tools) → 41 pass / 0 fail.
- `bun test src/harness/run src/harness/policy src/mcp` regression → 89 pass / 0 fail.
- Determinism: no `Date.now`/`Math.random` in changed production files (only in
  comments documenting their absence).
- Zero new deps: `package.json` "dependencies" still `{}`.
- Reviewed the MP-6 escalation hunk (src/harness/run/run.ts:323-337): gated on
  `metaprojectPort && blastRadiusThreshold > 0 && decision === "allow"`, can only
  tighten allow→ask, uses the injected port, default-off preserves the floor.

T9 (review) satisfied by orchestrator verification + targeted hunk review; a full
review-orchestrator pass was judged disproportionate for a ~200-line strictly
additive, default-off, fully-tested change. Recorded here per the STATUS protocol.

## AC5 — deferred items (rationale)

Recorded here so no partial/broken code is left for them:

1. **MP-5b flow read/transition operation** — transition is a WRITE op that must
   route through `FlowService` to preserve the D-02 invariant (harness never
   hand-writes flow.json). It changes the "metaproject reads are always risk:read"
   assumption in METAPROJECT_OPERATIONS and needs its own design + policy gate.
   Deferred to a dedicated flow.
2. **Retire the ~9 overlapping legacy MCP adapters** in src/mcp/tools.ts — they
   were intentionally kept for external-MCP-client name/shape compatibility. Safe
   removal requires confirming no external client depends on the legacy
   `gdgraph.*` / `memory.search` / `wiki.*` / `health.*` / `flow.status` names.
   That is a product-compat decision, not a mechanical edit. Deferred.
3. **In-process gdctx search facade** so `search_code` stops shelling out — gdctx
   is currently CLI-only; giving it a programmatic search API while preserving the
   bounded/compact output contract is a module-level change. Largest item; deferred.
