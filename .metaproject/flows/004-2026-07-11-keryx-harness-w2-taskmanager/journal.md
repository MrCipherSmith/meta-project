## Orchestrator notes — W2 verification & concerns

- **TDD RED→GREEN verified:** TM-02 RED (8 fail + 1 load-error, isolated to the two
  new test files; 16 pre-existing flow tests stayed green). TM-03 GREEN: full repo
  `bun test` = 554 pass / 0 fail; `tsc --noEmit` clean (independently re-run by
  orchestrator). `src/flow` = 34 pass / 0 fail.
- **Change scope:** 5 source files (types/store/service/machine + commands/flow) +
  2 new test files. Existing flows 001/002/003 `flow.json` byte-untouched (git
  clean); no lockfile/package.json churn committed.
- **TM-01 orchestrator validation:** all new fields optional, no existing field
  removed/required, schemaVersion 1→2 read-time migration, backward-compat matrix
  complete, D-02 preserved (runLink coordinator-only). Accepted.
- **Ratified test-scaffold cleanup:** TM-03 removed ONE obsolete `@ts-expect-error`
  line in disposition.test.ts (RED-phase directive on the not-yet-existing
  `taskGateStatus` import; became an unused-directive TS2578 error once the symbol
  was added — the directive comment itself said "TM-03 must add it"). No assertion,
  fixture, or expected value changed. Orchestrator ratified.
- **T8 review (Opus): PASS (clean)** — 8/8 checks PASS; AC3/AC4/AC5 SATISFIED.
  D-02 verified via `ctx rg`: `writeFlow` only called from TM `save`/`init`;
  `runLink` never assigned (stored reference type only); `taskGateStatus` pure and
  NOT wired into `complete()` (OPEN-4 correctly deferred).
- **Two LOW non-blocking notes (deferred, not fixed — no AC/spec violation):**
  (1) `service.ts` `check()` schemaVersion!=1&&!=2 branch is effectively unreachable
  after read-time migration (defensive, harmless); (2) `init()` still writes
  schemaVersion:1 for new flows — spec-compatible (read normalizes to v2, first
  mutation rewrites v2), optional future tidy. Both recorded for a later wave.
- **Minor routing deviation logged:** TM-03 used bare `grep` twice (schemaVersion
  cross-check + package.json lookup) instead of `keryx ctx rg`; no impact.
- **Env note:** worktree needed `bun install` (missing dev type deps) before tsc;
  did not dirty tracked files.
- 2026-07-12T15:05:25.235Z - ac-confirmed: AC1: TM-01 spec: 7 additive OPTIONAL fields, schemaVersion 1->2 read-time migration, backward-compat matrix (FlowTask+FlowState+CLI), 8 OPEN items. Orchestrator-validated.
- 2026-07-12T15:05:25.290Z - ac-confirmed: AC2: TM-02: migration.test.ts + disposition.test.ts; deterministic v1->v2 fixtures (todo/in-progress/done+/-history), all 4 dispositions, negative schemaVersion>2 case. RED verified before TM-03.
- 2026-07-12T15:05:25.342Z - ac-confirmed: AC3: TM-03: additive fields + pure v1->v2 migration in src/flow; flows 001-004 load, list/status/check unchanged; --depends/--disposition settable; check accepts 1&2; TM-02 GREEN (34/34).
- 2026-07-12T15:05:25.392Z - ac-confirmed: AC4: D-02 preserved: writeFlow only in TM save/init; runLink never assigned (reference type only); taskGateStatus pure & unwired; no 2nd coordinator. T8 review PASS.
- 2026-07-12T15:05:25.449Z - ac-confirmed: AC5: tsc --noEmit clean; full bun test 554 pass/0 fail; legacy v1 flow.json byte-untouched (git clean); code-verifier PASS.
