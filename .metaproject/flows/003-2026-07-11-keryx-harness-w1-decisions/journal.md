## Orchestrator notes — worker concerns (DONE, no blockers)

- **Scenario-tag mapping (all three of D-02/D-03/D-04, independently verified):** the
  literal tokens `S-02/S-04/S-06/S-08/S-09` and `R1-01/R1-03` are the
  implementation-plan §W1 *abstract* scenario references, NOT literal labels in
  `specification.md` (`ctx rg` → zero literal hits). Each worker mapped every token
  to its concrete realization (owning spec section + matching `acceptance.feature`
  tag, e.g. `@SC_R09_SINGLE_COORDINATOR`, `@SC_R05_HARD_DENY`) and documented the
  mapping inside its ADR. Recorded in `decision-registry.md` §"Traceability note".
  Verdict: labeling convention, not a spec contradiction. Handed to T9 review to
  confirm.
- **D-04 used one targeted raw `grep`** on individual schema JSON files to extract
  byte-exact `$id` strings (ctx-rg compact summary truncates). Stated reason logged
  in its routing audit; acceptable per the "raw rg last-resort with stated reason"
  rule.
- **D-02 contradiction check:** verdict NO-CONTRADICTION (8/8 ownership claims).
- **D-03 fail-closed:** explicit typed-BLOCK on missing containment; Release 0
  permits only `read-only-review`.
- Deferred questions preserved as OPEN-1…OPEN-4 across ADR-0001/ADR-0004 and the
  research ledger; none guessed.
- Registry: D-01…D-04 all flipped to SIGNED by orchestrator (workers did not touch
  the registry, avoiding a write race).

- 2026-07-11T20:55:49.424Z - ac-confirmed: AC1: ADR-0001: R0 offline/read-only boundary + 10 measurable success criteria (PRD+R0-01..03) + 24-item signed table; no unresolved boundary. T9 PASS.
- 2026-07-11T20:55:49.481Z - ac-confirmed: AC2: ADR-0002: Task Manager sole coordinator; 14-row ownership/import matrix, inward ports; contradiction-check vs S-06/R1-03 => NO-CONTRADICTION. T9 PASS.
- 2026-07-11T20:55:49.535Z - ac-confirmed: AC3: ADR-0003: profile/isolation matrix mapped to policy-profile.schema.json (real profileId enums) + S-04/R1-01/M-02; explicit typed fail-closed. T9 PASS.
- 2026-07-11T20:55:49.589Z - ac-confirmed: AC4: ADR-0004: provider/branch/child records linked to real schema $id (S-02/S-08/S-09) + research-ledger; OPEN-1..4 preserved, none guessed. T9 PASS.
- 2026-07-11T20:55:49.640Z - ac-confirmed: AC5: decision-registry: D-01..04 SIGNED; four ADRs mutually consistent & consistent with frozen pkg; docs/requirements unmodified (git clean). T9 PASS.
