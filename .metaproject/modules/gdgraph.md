# gdgraph

## Purpose

Builds code graph, symbol graph, dependency map, and affected context.

Current MVP builds a file dependency graph plus imported asset nodes. Generated
frontend/static outputs are skipped by default.

## Commands

- `keryx gdgraph build`
- `keryx gdgraph find "<terms>"` — find files/symbols by concept (seed search)
- `keryx gdgraph symbol "<name>"` — definition + callers + callees (symbol layer)
- `keryx gdgraph path "<A>" "<B>"` — shortest connection between two files/symbols
- `keryx gdgraph affected <file-or-symbol>` — blast radius
- `keryx gdgraph query cycles | orphans`
- `keryx gdgraph symbols <enable|disable|status>` — opt-in tree-sitter symbol layer

## Data

- `data/gdgraph/artifacts/summary.md`
- `data/gdgraph/artifacts/module-map.json`
- `data/gdgraph/storage/nodes.jsonl`
- `data/gdgraph/storage/edges.jsonl`

## Frontend Defaults

- skips `storybook-static`, `public`, `.docusaurus`, `.next`, `out`, `dist`, `build`, `coverage`, and `generated`;
- resolves imported CSS, JSON, SVG, handlebars/raw templates, images and fonts as asset nodes;
- reports source files, asset nodes, import resolution, skipped directories, top modules, and unresolved imports by type.
