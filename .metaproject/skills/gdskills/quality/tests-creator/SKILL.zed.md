# Tests Creator

Converts acceptance criteria → failing test stubs (RED phase).

**Pipeline position:** issue-analyzer → **tests-creator** → task-implementer

## Steps
1. Detect test framework (`package.json`, existing tests)
2. Map each acceptance criterion to test scenarios
3. Write failing test stubs (forward-declared API calls)
4. Commit test files
5. Run tests — verify RED state
6. Report `TEST_CASE_SPECS`

## Output
```
TEST_CASE_SPECS:
  framework: vitest
  test_files: [{ path, target_module, test_count, tests: [...] }]
  run_command: "bun test ..."
  expected_result: "all failing (RED phase)"

STATUS: DONE
tests_written: N
all_criteria_covered: true
```
