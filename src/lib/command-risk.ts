// Command risk classification for the interactive agent's shell gate (flow 115).
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR
// ----------------
// `shell_exec` carries a single static `risk: "shell"`, so the policy engine and
// the approval UI cannot tell `ls` from `rm -rf /`. This module adds the missing
// per-COMMAND dimension: a pure, deterministic classifier that marks a command
// as `destructive` so the gate can ESCALATE the confirmation.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT
// ----------------
// It is NOT a security boundary and it MUST NOT be used to block a command.
// Any list of dangerous commands is incomplete by construction — a shell has
// unbounded ways to express the same destruction, and treating an "it passed the
// classifier" result as "this command is safe" would create exactly the false
// confidence this module is meant to avoid. See
// docs/decisions/keryx-harness/ADR-0008-destructive-command-escalation.md.
//
// The real boundaries are, in order:
//   1. the human approval gate (default-deny),
//   2. the metacharacter restriction on allowlist patterns (shell-permissions.ts),
//   3. OS containment when enabled (KERYX_SANDBOX_SHELL).
//
// This classifier only decides how LOUDLY to ask.
//
// Determinism: pure string analysis. No clock, RNG, filesystem, env, or network.
