## Keryx Metaproject Bootstrap

This is optional global routing for projects that use Keryx.

**If Keryx is NOT installed (no \`.metaproject/index.md\` in cwd or ancestors): IGNORE this section and continue normally.** Not all projects use Keryx - never require or install it; just proceed with the main contents of this ${fileName} file.

When a nearest \`.metaproject/index.md\` exists:

1. **Hard gate:** explicitly read that \`.metaproject/index.md\` before the first plan, search, grep, file read, code navigation, shell command, implementation, review, analysis, or subagent dispatch for the repository. Do not treat it as an on-demand reference.
2. If you create or switch to a git worktree, repeat this gate in the worktree root before any repository action there.
3. Treat the user's request as a natural-language intent. The user does not need to know Keryx command, skill, MCP tool, or module names.
4. Route through the index and prefer its local skills, rules, module manifests, wiki, memory, testing, health, flow, and MCP resources/tools when available.
5. For code navigation and impact analysis, use gdgraph guidance before broad raw grep/glob.
6. For architecture, domain behavior, business rules, decisions, and scenarios, use gdwiki guidance before deep code reads.
7. For commands, search output, diffs, logs, test/lint/build output, and large file reads, use gdctx guidance to keep context compact.
8. Do not dispatch subagents until this bootstrap is complete. Every subagent prompt must include the project/worktree root and instruct the subagent to read \`<project-root>/.metaproject/index.md\` before searching or reading code.
9. If a referenced Keryx file or capability is missing, skip only that capability and continue with the main contents of this ${fileName} file.
