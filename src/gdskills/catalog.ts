## Local-First Rules

1. Start from \`.metaproject/index.md\` and \`.metaproject/skills/catalog.md\`.
2. Prefer project-local skills under \`.metaproject/project-skills\` and \`.metaproject/skills/gdskills\`.
3. Use \`gdgraph\`, \`gdctx\`, \`gdwiki\`, Code Health, and Documentation Memory when they provide narrower context.
4. Treat external/global skills only as explicit fallback when local Metaproject does not provide the capability.
5. Verify conclusions against source files before reporting or editing.

## Agent Command Contract

When the user asks in natural language to create a skill, for example \`создай скил для init.ts\`, \`создай скилл для src/commands/init.ts\`, or \`create a skill for <path>\`, the agent must run the CLI flow itself. Do not ask the user to run these commands manually.

Required flow:

\`\`\`bash
gd-metapro skills create <target> --module <module> --name <skill-name>
gd-metapro skills route <target>
gd-metapro skills inspect <module>/<skill-name>
gd-metapro skills verify <module>/<skill-name>
gd-metapro skills status
\`\`\`

Inference rules:

1. If the user gives only a basename such as \`init.ts\`, resolve it with graph/search first and use the matching project path.
2. Infer \`--module\` from the closest stable project area when omitted.
3. Infer \`--name\` from the entity or file purpose, using kebab-case.
4. If multiple targets match, ask one short clarification question before creating anything.
5. Report created files, verification status, and next recommended action.

Profile: ${profile}
Generated By: gd-metapro

This catalog lists project-local working skills installed by \`gd-metapro\`.

Resolution order:

1. \`.metaproject/index.md\`
2. \`.metaproject/skills/catalog.md\`
3. \`.metaproject/project-skills/**\`
4. \`.metaproject/skills/gdskills/**\`
5. Explicitly allowed global fallback skills

## Agent Shortcuts

- User says \`создай скил для <path>\`, \`создай скилл для <file>\`, or \`create a skill for <target>\`: load \`gdskills/core/entity-skill-creator/SKILL.md\` and run the create-route-inspect-verify-status CLI flow yourself.
- User asks which project skill applies to a file/task: run \`gd-metapro skills route <query-or-target>\` before reading broad files.
- User asks whether a project skill is still valid: run \`gd-metapro skills verify <skill-or-target>\`.
- User asks to create/update a Metaproject requirements package, PRD/spec package, or \`docs/requirements/<name>\` documentation: load \`gdskills/planning/docpack-orchestrator/SKILL.md\`; use \`autodoc-orchestrator\` instead only for reverse-engineering documentation from the current codebase.
